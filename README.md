# EMS-Website

What it does: 
We have designed a revamped version of the RVREMS website in order to make it more accessible by users and make it more user-friendly. 
People can learn about the company, rent a hall, sign up to volunteer and also be able to donate anonymously.

How we built it: 
We built the frontend using React, and built our website around that and thinking about what we needed as we started to code.

Challenges we ran into: 
The original challenge that we were given was just to make a donation page for the website but we took a step further to revamp the entire website. 
We made the website

Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
Using the Stripe API along with having a Paypal button was an accomplishment that we are proud of because of the complexity of the Stripe Documentation 
and all the intricacies that it involves when using it.

What we learned: 
Leveraging React elements to build a simple, sleek webpage Working with Asynchronous Functions to process requests and interface with a web server.

What's next for RVREMS Revamp: 
If we were given more time to finish RVREMS Revamp, we would add more functionality to the whole website since most of our time was trying to figure how 
everything worked together. Also, adding more styling to be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
